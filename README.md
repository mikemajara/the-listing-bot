# the-listing-bot

Bot to create simple numbered lists in Telegram groups with ease.

Each list has a title and 0 or more elements. You can easily add elements to the list using a menu button. The list is numbered to ease counting for a potential event. Elements can be names or arbitrary strings with an owner. Users must have a name or username set up in Telegram; these are used for the list for convenience.
